# DodingGame

## compile 
$ javac windows.java
## run the application, where height and width are size of game windows
$ java windows height width 


## Tips:
1. The way to control player are typing 'a' to move player to left and typing 'd' to move player to right.
2. The application may not work on Windows since I have not had windows sys to test it.
